# 🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis Project - Task 04

This project analyzes traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Additionally, it visualizes accident hotspots using geographical heatmaps.

## 📌 Objective

To identify the key factors contributing to road accidents using data visualization techniques and gain insights that can help improve road safety.

## 🔍 Task Highlights

- 📊 Analyze accident frequency based on:
  - Road conditions
  - Weather conditions
  - Time of day
- 🗺️ Visualize accident hotspots using geospatial data (Latitude & Longitude)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Date & Time of accidents
- Weather and Road conditions
- GPS Coordinates (Latitude and Longitude)

> A sample dataset is included: `accident_dataset_with_location.csv`

## 📊 Visualizations

- Countplot of accidents by **road condition**
- Countplot of accidents by **weather condition**
- Histogram of accidents by **hour of the day**
- Geospatial **heatmap** of accident locations


💡 *This analysis can support city planners, traffic departments, and safety advocates in understanding and mitigating accident risks.*
